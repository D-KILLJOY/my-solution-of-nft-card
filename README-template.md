## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

First i had to think about to arrange every HTML element and how to style them
After that i started writing the HTML part of the code and when i was done, i moved to the CSS and then i thought about how i could arrange the SVG images and when i got a way i tried it and it worked and i went on with the challenge and finished it.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt a little about using SVG and the fact that there are many ways to do the same ting in CSS

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own learnings.**
